NATURE SIMULATION SCENE

Scene Idea - Sky Island Simulation Scene

Description:
A simulation scene of a sky island, with cameras rotating, switching out to another camera, the scene will have environmental effects such as rain, thunderstorm and blizzards, animals will wander around on the island, leaves fall, plant life grow and dies. 



Style:
Models will preferably be made in unity or in blender instead of importing third party works, that will otherwise cause art style clashes, a low poly is my preferred style as it makes models easier to make, nice to look at, and decreases the scope in artstyle to be doable in the assignment time period
