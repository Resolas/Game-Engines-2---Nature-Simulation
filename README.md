Game Pitch:
An simple RTS game where the aim of the game is you as a machine hive mind, seek to wipe out all life across the universe

Description:
You control only one type of unit, whose purpose is to construct gargantuan machines capable of annihilating planets and civilizations alike, such as giant thrusters to redirect a celestial mass into another, build machines capable of harnessing a star's power to incinerate planets, or you can simply build fully autonomous space factories to construct ships that will automatically attack the opposing world, of course we it wouldn't be without resistance, the opposing civilizations will send out fleets to fight back leading to a big space battle.
