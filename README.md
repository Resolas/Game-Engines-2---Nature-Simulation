Game Idea - Planet Destroyer Game

Game Pitch:
An simple RTS game where the aim of the game is you as a machine hive mind, seek to wipe out all life across the universe

Description:
You control only one type of unit, whose purpose is to construct gargantuan machines capable of annihilating planets and civilizations alike, such as giant thrusters to redirect a celestial mass into another, build machines capable of harnessing a star's power to incinerate planets, or you can simply build fully autonomous space factories to construct ships that will automatically attack the opposing world, of course we it wouldn't be without resistance, the opposing civilizations will send out fleets to fight back leading to a big space battle.


Backlog:

NATURE SIMULATION SCENE

Scene Idea - Sky Island Simulation Scene

Description:
A simulation scene of a sky island, with cameras rotating, switching out to another camera, the scene will have environmental effects such as rain, thunderstorm and blizzards, animals will wander around on the island, leaves fall, plant life grow and dies. 



Style:
Models will preferably be made in unity or in blender instead of importing third party works, that will otherwise cause art style clashes, a low poly is my preferred style as it makes models easier to make, nice to look at, and decreases the scope in artstyle to be doable in the assignment time period
